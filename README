# Search for appropriate candidates on Github or Stackoverflow

It searches for the candidates for our matches
I hope integration with my database would not cause problem. I know it will cause a problem. In case of such thing you can contact me so I can work on my computer.
Also, I used different tecniques for Github and Stackoverflow. For Github, I basically render the html file with beatiful soup while I used stackapi for Stackoverflow.
Please activate my-env by typing my-env\Scripts\activate, then type cd assignment, then run the server typing python manage.py runserver. 


## Using Github Search

You should write any sentence that is either one word or multiple, then enter candidate nunmber you would like to see, then in sorting type write desc for descending, write asc for ascending, and for the sort type write one of the followings: follower, repositories or best match.
Then, wait until page is reloaded again since it takes a lot of time to retrieve data from Github and save it to PostgreSQL. Then, you can look at the details from the Github Details 
page.

## Using StackoverFlow Search
You should write one word since I could not figure out it in stackapi. Then, you can write your candidate number preference then wait for the page loading
since it takes a lot of time to be uploaded, then you can look the details from the Stackoverflow details page.
